            <img src="Images/coconut.jpeg" alt="loading" width="350" height="200">
            <p>The establishment of Kenya Coconut Development Authority (KCDA)
            in July 2008 and government’s move to classify the coconut tree
            as a “special crop” giving it the same status like coffee and tea,
            is expected to revive the sector.
            <br> <br>
            KCDA has since been transformed to Nuts and Oil Crops Directorate
            (NOCD) under the agricultural regulator, Agriculture, Fisheries and
            Food Authority.<br>
            <br>
            According to NOCD, Coconut produces over 100 byproducts with the
            potential to generate over Sh.13 billion annually, which represents
            0.4 percent to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) against
            the current production worth sh. 3.2 billion.

            Farmers are encouraged to plant the hybrid coconut plants form Kenya

                <p>Locally known as “mrangi”, for its bright red fruits that have numerous seeds,
                Bixa is a cash crop introduced into Kenya’s Coast region in the 1970s.
                There are two Bixa seasons in a year. The crop does well in the and is mainly
                grown in Kwale, Mswambweni, Lamu, Malindi and Kiunga, near the Somalia border.
                Matuga Kenya Agricultural Research Institute officer Finyange Pole says Bixa
                is crucial for Kwale County, although many people don’t grow the crop.

                <p>The  Kwale county government has started distribution of 30 dairy cows and seven
                calves to small scale farmers with a view to boosting milk production in the region.
                She  called on the beneficiary farmers to practice prudent follow-up of the
                cattle to realize the dream of making Kwale self-sufficient in milk production.
                <br> <br>
                According to the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Fatuma Achan, The County is working towards
                realizing the dream of our people by ensuring that we deliver great services to them.
                She also witnessed the handing over of a dairy calf from one farmer to another for free.
                <br> <br>
                Last year, the County distributed hundreds of hybrid bulls, goats and dairy
                cattle to farmers in a bid to transform livestock farming in Kwale and unlock the
                untapped livestock opportunities.
